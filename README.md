# Bus-Path-Finding

Objectives:
- To learn about path finding
- Figure out how to calculate distance between bus stops in singapore
- Calculate time difference between different bus routes to the same destination, inclusive of waiting time (i.e. is it worth it to take a longer route if the bus is already at the stop compared to waiting for the bus with the shortest route if an alternative route exists)

Side objectives
- To find out if there is a difference in cost based on different bus routes to the same destination
- Maybe export to something more convenient to carry like a phone/tablet
- Maybe something like a comfort (?) calculator based on how full the bus is (I remember the API has something relating to this) - then make a decision whether to wait for the next bus? (can gather data for the bus over time to make a density over time map??)
